        Can you think of any things that need to be finished before you can start on this project?


        <!-- If possible, this should be some kind of input that allows the user to enter a bulleted list -->
        {# this syntax around project.getId is string interpolation in Twig #}
        {% set vars = {
            'form_url': "/coach/new_project/#{ project.getId }/step",
            'input_value': 'dump',
            'label_text': 'Prerequisites'
            }
        %}
        {% include 'coach/partials/simple_qa_form.html.twig' with vars %}

        ((include project so far template display))

        (brain dump here) post to /{id}/step
