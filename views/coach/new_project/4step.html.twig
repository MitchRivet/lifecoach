        Take a look at what you came up with. Here's your dump:<br>
        {{ dump }}<br><br>

        {% if project.getSteps|length == 0 %}
            Looking at your dump, what do you think is the most basic step possible you could start this project with?
        {% else %}
            What is the next smallest step that needs to be done?
        {% endif %}

        <form action="/coach/new_project/{{ project.getId }}/step" method="post">
            <!-- pass dump in hidden post so user can continue to reference it-->
            <input type="hidden" name="dump" value="{{dump}}">
            <label for="step_description">Step description</label>
            <input type="text" name="step_description">
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>

        <a href="/coach/new_project/{{ project.getId }}/due_date">No More Steps</a><br><br>

        ((include project so far template display))

        ((form to add a step)) post to /{id}/step as long as we keep adding steps
        go to /{id}/due_date if there are no more steps
    </body>
